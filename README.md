# Tranformations_2D

This project demonstrates basic 2D transformations using Python. It includes classes for representing points and performing translations and rotations. The transformations are visualized using `matplotlib`.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have `numpy` and `matplotlib` installed:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy matplotlib
    ```

2. Run the `main.py` script to see the transformations and plot:
    ```bash
    python3 main.py
    ```

## Description

- **Point2D**: Represents a point in 2D space with methods for addition and plotting.
- **Translate**: Represents a translation transformation.
- **Rotate**: Represents a rotation transformation.
- **Transformation**: Combines multiple transformations.

The `main.py` script demonstrates creating points, applying transformations, and visualizing the results.
